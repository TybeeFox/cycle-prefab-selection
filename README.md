# Cycle Prefab Selection

A simple Unity utility that allows the user to cycle through Prefabs in the Scene View using 'Alt + Mouse Scroll'.

What's this?
It's a Unity Editor Utility inspired by a feature from the Fallout 4 Creation Kit that lets you cycle objects simply by holding 'Alt' and Scrolling the mouse wheel. It's mostly just a quality of life thing that I wanted to have for doing Level Design stuff in Unity because I tend to work with a lot of modular kits, figured other people might like to make use of it.

How do I use it?
- Download 'CyclePrefabSelection.cs' or clone the repo if you like.
- Add 'CyclePrefabSelection.cs' to your Unity project within a folder called 'Editor'.
- Once added to your project, if you select a Prefab instance in the Scene View and hold 'Alt' and Scroll the mouse wheel up or down you can cycle through all the Prefabs that live in the same directory as the one selected.
- Save a bunch of time.
- Profit?

Plans for future updates?
I'm currently looking into supporting multiple object selections because at the moment only the top level selection is cycled, you can probably expect that change to happen in the next day or so.
