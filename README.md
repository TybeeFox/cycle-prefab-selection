# Cycle Prefab Selection

A simple Unity utility that allows the user to cycle through Prefabs in the Scene View using 'Alt + Mouse Scroll'.

What's this?
- It's a Unity Editor Utility inspired by a feature from the Fallout 4 Creation Kit that lets you cycle objects simply by holding 'Alt' and Scrolling the mouse wheel. It's mostly just a quality of life thing that I wanted to have for doing Level Design stuff in Unity because I tend to work with a lot of modular kits, figured other people might like to make use of it.

What can I do with the code?
- You can pretty much do whatever you want with the code provided here, just don't go trying to sell it, that's kind of a shitty thing to do given that I've released it here for free.
- You're welcome to integrate it into larger projects and/or frameworks if you want, you're not expected to release your entire code base as a result of integrating this into a larger project or collection of code, that would be a bit silly.

How do I use it?
- Download 'CyclePrefabSelection.cs' or clone the repo if you like.
- Add 'CyclePrefabSelection.cs' to your Unity project within a folder called 'Editor'.
- Once added to your project, if you select a Prefab instance (or multiple) in the Scene View and hold 'Alt' and Scroll the mouse wheel up or down you can cycle through all the Prefabs that live in the same directory as the one selected.
- As of Unity 2018.3.X you can also hold 'Alt + Shift' and Scroll the mouse wheel to only cycle through the Prefab Variants of the selected object.
- Save a bunch of time.
- Profit?

Plans for future updates?
- I'm currently looking into ways that I can enhance this utility further with the advent of the new nested prefab workflow in Unity 2018.3.
